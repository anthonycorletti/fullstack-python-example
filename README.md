# fullstack-python-example

dreaming of a way to do full stack software development with python only.

this is a place to test ideas and have some fun. i wouldn't try this in production without more attention to detail and testing.

sometimes you gotta have fun with software, you know?

an important next step could be interacting with remote sqlite on modal.
